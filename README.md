Part 1: Create a Framework which has one method (eg weatherInfo) that takes latitude longitude or address( as string) as parameters and method should return the weather details for that location.(you can use google weather api for that )

Part 2: create one sample Project in Xcode and use the above framework either directly or through pods (for this you need to publish the framework to pods) and use its method(weatherInfo) in your sample Project.
